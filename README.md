I am using Nerd font, exa, bat, and ripgrep. 

I have almost everything configured to use some variant of the gruvbox theme.

The keyboard repo contains code for using the event interface through python-evdev to contruct arbitrary 
keyboard layouts. Its pretty messy right now, but it works quite well.

Submodules in this repo may not be on latest.
